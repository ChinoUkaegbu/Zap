## Description

Zap! is based on the popular arcade game Asteroids with a few, slight modifications.

It is a space-themed one player game which features the single player controlling a spaceship that shoots laser beams. The objective of the game is to defend the spaceship from attacks from the attacking spaceships that would periodically shoot laser beams at the spaceship. Each hit inflicts damage to the spaceship, resulting in a deduction from the number of lives. The game begins with 3 lives and the objective is to eliminate all attack spaceships from the game without losing any or all the playerâ€™s lives..

If all the lives are exhausted before the attacking spaceships are eliminated, the player loses the game.

The player uses the arrow keys to move in the respective directions and uses the spacebar to shoot laser beams at the attacking spaceships. The saucers in turn move in a block shape and continuously shoot laser beams downwards, until they are eliminated.
