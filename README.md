## Description

Zap! is based on the popular arcade game Asteroids with a few, slight modifications.

It is a space-themed one player game which features the single player controlling a spaceship that
shoots laser beams. The objective of the game is to defend the spaceship from attacks from the
attacking spaceships that would periodically shoot laser beams at the spaceship. Each hit inflicts
damage to the spaceship, resulting in a deduction from the number of lives. The game begins with 3
lives and the objective is to eliminate all attack spaceships from the game without losing any or all
the playerâ€™s lives..

If all the lives are exhausted before the attacking spaceships are eliminated, the player loses the
game.

The player uses the arrow keys to move in the respective directions and uses the spacebar to shoot
laser beams at the attacking spaceships. The saucers in turn move in a block shape and continuously
shoot laser beams downwards, until they are eliminated.
